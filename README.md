# Decision-support-system-exercises
Decision support system solutions implemented in python

Exercises from a Computer Engineering course done on Aarhus University spring 2017. 
The course was taught using the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning - with applications in R" by James, Gareth, et. al. 
The "lab###" corresponds to the exercises numbering in the book. The exercises are implemented in python. 

The exercises contains implementation of the following: 
Linear regression
lab362.py - Simple linear Regression
lab363.py - Multiple Linear Regression

Discriminant Analysis
lab463.py - Linear Discriminant Analysis
lab464.py - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
lab465.py - K-Nearest Neighbors

Linear model selection (subset selection)
lab651.py - Best Subset Selection
lab652.py - Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection
lab653.py - Choosing Among Models Using the Validation Set Approach and Cross-Validation

The exercises are based around dataset included in the R-distribution. These are also available here https://github.com/selva86/datasets
